            <h1>What I bring to the table.</h1>
             <p>I'm a mathematics graduate with a Master's degree in Mathematics and Statistics from the University of Ottawa. My academic journey has equipped me with a deep understanding of advanced mathematical concepts and their practical applications, making me uniquely positioned for success in the realm of software development. My master's thesis, "Embedding r-Factorizations of Complete Uniform Hypergraphs into s-Factorizations," showcases my proficiency in tackling complex problems and presenting solutions. I had the privilege of sharing my research at the 27th annual Ontario Combinatorics Workshop, refining not only my mathematical skills but also my ability to communicate and network within the international mathematical community.</p>
            

            <p>During my time as a Teaching Assistant at the University of Ottawa, I honed my ability to present complex material to individuals of varying familiarity with the field. This experience, coupled with my Magna Cum Laude Bachelor's degree, demonstrates my excellence in subjects ranging from combinatorics and discrete math to machine learning and programming.</p>

            <p>In addition to my mathematical prowess, I bring a robust skill set in programming languages such as Python, R, SQL, Visual Basic, C, MATLAB, HTML, and CSS. My proficiency in algorithm design and optimization, coupled with strong analytical reasoning, positions me as a valuable asset for software development projects. Fluent in English, native in French, and with intermediate proficiency in German, I possess excellent written and verbal communication skills, essential for effective collaboration and teamwork.</p>
